I believe I don't have to describe what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">primes</a> are, what are their properties and what not. This post is more a tribute to geek-ness of 2 friends-and-colleagues (<a href="http://twitter.com/lucabox">@lucabox</a>) that have fun thinking of algorithms to solve stupid (or less stupid), and always useless problems ;-) .

Optimus Prime :-P - yeah yeah, a stupid joke

## Briefing
This code is based on the assumption that we want to generate very very large primes, so it uses <code>unsigned long long</code> to store the values, instead of classical <code>unsigned int</code>. Live with that.

Also, give that there is nothing much better then a <em>"try-dividing-by-every-previous-prime"</em> out there (there are alternatives, but I'm not aware of more complex ones), I took a look to some properties of Primes, and putted into the algorithm those properties as <strong>conditions for early stop</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Say <code>P[i]</code> are the previously calculated Primes; If trying dividing value <code>V</code> by every <code>P[i]</code> we find that <code>P[i] &gt; sqrt(V)</code>, stop dividing and classify <code>V</code> as a newly found prime</li>
<li><strong>No need to check any even number</strong>: they are divisible by 2, so no primes by definition</li>
<li><strong>No need to allocate more space then an array of the size of the requested prime <em>ordinality</em></strong>: everything can be done in place</li>
</ol>

    ull limit = (ull)sqrt(value);

        // Check if the value is divisible by this prime
        if ( value % primes[i] == 0 ) return FALSE;
        // Check if it's enough. Limit sqrt(value) exceded

Time Complexity of this algorithm is quite complex to calculate. Without <strong>condition 1.</strong> described above, we could quickly say that the complexity is an <strong>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</strong>.

But I believe is more complex then that. Overall speaking, the complexity above is indeed correct, but it does vary a lot, because of the <strong>condition 1.</strong>: the number of times in which <code>P[i] will be &gt; sqrt(V)</code> grows with the square value of P[i]. Means that the bigger the prime, the easier is to find the upper-bound of the modulo operations that will be actually executed. This <em>could</em> make the complexity also something like an <strong>&Omega;(n * log(n))</strong>. But this assertion is far from tested/demonstrated/verified, so I could be boldly wrong.
