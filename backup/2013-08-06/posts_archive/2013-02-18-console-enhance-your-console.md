I need a logger for [GhostDriver](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver) but I'm too lazy to figure out how to use a nice, proper logging library. Plus I'm a BIG fun of old-school-debugging: I just substituted all the `printf()` calls with `console.log`.

So I decide to make every JavaScript developer _shiver in disgust_ and wrote a small library that enhances the global `console` object.

This tiny library is called [Console++](https://github.com/detro/consoleplusplus) and works with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) and any decent JavaScript runtime.

It does output colouring, adds timestamps and log level to the lines, and can be used to redirect the output to other media than the console (just register a callback). On `node`, just type `npm install consoleplusplus` to get started.

It's so simple that the [README](https://github.com/detro/consoleplusplus/blob/master/README.md) is more than enough to use it.

It's under [BSD license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses), so you can have fun with it.
