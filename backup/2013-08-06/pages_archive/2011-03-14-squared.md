Squared is a theme I developed for ([my fork of](https://github.com/detro/bloggart)) Bloggart. **And it's in front of you right now!** Nice, isn't it.

A "recursive" screenshot ;)

When I did the design I focused on few aspects:

* **content** - one column with large, readable text
* **black on white** - strongest contrast for better reading
* **no distraction** - very little extra, with less prominent colors
* **HTML & CSS** - compliance with latest [HTML](http://www.w3.org/html/) and [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) specs

The final best touches of style were inspired (and sometimes even coded) by [Ekynoxe](http://ekynoxe.com/) - thanks mate ;-).

The source is part of my fork of Bloggart, and can be found [here](https://github.com/detro/bloggart/tree/master/themes/squared). Enjoy!
