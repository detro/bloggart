[txty.mobi](http://www.txty.mobi/) is a service that let's you send your phone's SMS, using a web application. You can type your messages on your favourite, wide computer keyboard.

It was built out of the free time of [those 3 guys](http://www.txty.mobi/aboutus): it's definitely neither polished nor complete, but:

* it's free
* it has some users
* we run it on App Engine (for free)
* we add some features every once in a while
