Bloggart is a _blog application_ for Google App Engine.
Is written in Python and uses all the Google App Engine Python goodness.

## A bit of history

It was originally developed as a demonstration app from Nick Johnson for
[a series of blog posts](http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine),
and intended to be a useful and versatile blogging system for App Engine by the time it's done.

I forked it up and I'm making it "mine", feature by feature.

## Features

This engine is not designed to be in anyway comparable to stuff like _Wordpress et similia_.
The idea is to provide a developer, possibly an App Engine developer, a way to run a personal
blog on the Google Cloud: Quickly set it up and, if necessary, tweak the hell out of it!

There are different features I want to add. This is a live list of what's pending and what's done:

* Support for 'Pages', instead of just 'Posts'
* **[DONE]** JS and CSS 'Minification' (no obfuscation though)
* **[DONE]** JS and CSS 'Templating' (i.e. Being able to use App Engine Djiango Template grammar into JS and CSS files)
* **[DONE]** JS and CSS 'Memcaching'
* **[DONE]** Show line numbers for '&lt;pre&gt;sourcecode&lt;/pre&gt;' areas in posts
* Add more themes:
    * **[DONE]** Coolblue
    * A personal, HTML5-based theme

## Original Logo

This is Bloggart original logo from Nick. I'd like to steak with it for now.
